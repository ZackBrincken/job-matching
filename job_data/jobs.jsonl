{"title": "Manager of IT Support", "company": "GardaWorld Security Services U.S.", "location": "St. Louis, MO 63144", "full_description": ":\nLead our growing IT Support Team!\n\nWe are seeking a highly organized and detail-oriented Manager of IT Support to oversee the daily operations of our IT support team. This position is responsible for ensuring efficient, timely, and high-quality technical assistance for internal users. The ideal candidate will have a hands-on approach, ensuring smooth troubleshooting, resolution of IT issues, and managing the operations of the support function while maintaining high levels of customer service.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for You\nCompetitive Salary: $80,000+ / year\nWork Site Location: St. Louis, MO\nSet Schedule: Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. This position may require long hours and weekend work.\nComprehensive Benefits: Medical, dental, and vision insurance plans, 401(k) with employer matching contributions, paid time off (PTO) policy, paid holidays, disability coverage, and life insurance options.\nCareer Growth: Career growth opportunities at GardaWorld\nTravel: Travel expectations vary by branch, with daily visits to client sites within the market.\n\nYour Responsibilities\nTeam Leadership & Supervision: Lead and manage a team of IT support specialists, ensuring that each team member is properly trained and equipped to handle technical support requests. Example: Conduct regular one-on-one meetings with team members to discuss performance, provide constructive feedback, and identify professional development needs. Additionally, foster a collaborative team environment by organizing weekly team check-ins to address challenges, share best practices, and discuss any technical advancements or updates.\nIncident & Request Management: Oversee the daily management of the helpdesk system, ensuring that all IT incidents and service requests are logged accurately and promptly. Example: Monitor ticket queues and ensure that tickets are assigned to the appropriate team members based on their expertise. For example, a hardware issue might be escalated to a specialized technician, while a software issue may be handled by a generalist. Maintain a resolution workflow where escalated issues are triaged and followed up with end-users to ensure satisfaction.\nOperational Efficiency: Streamline support processes and ensure high productivity levels within the IT support team. Example: Create and enforce guidelines for issue prioritization, ensuring that critical issues (such as network outages) are handled immediately while lower-priority items (like software updates) are scheduled accordingly. Monitor team workload to prevent burnout, ensuring that the ticket backlog is consistently managed and that support requests are addressed in a timely manner according to defined SLAs.\nCustomer Support: Serve as the point of escalation for complex IT support issues that require senior-level troubleshooting. Example: If a user experiences a system-wide application failure, step in to personally troubleshoot and resolve the issue, or involve other departments as needed. Communicate effectively with end-users throughout the process, offering clear timelines for resolution and checking in regularly to provide updates.\nDocumentation & Knowledge Base Management: Ensure that IT issues, solutions, and troubleshooting steps are accurately documented and accessible for future use. Example: After resolving a complex issue, create a step-by-step guide or troubleshooting procedure and add it to the internal knowledge base for future reference. Regularly review the knowledge base to ensure all solutions are up-to-date and reflect the current IT environment. Encourage the team to contribute to knowledge sharing to ensure that recurring issues can be quickly resolved.\nSystems Monitoring & Reporting: Track key performance metrics such as ticket resolution times, customer satisfaction, and the overall performance of the IT support team. Example: Analyze monthly performance reports to identify trends, such as recurring technical issues that might indicate a need for a larger infrastructure change. Based on these insights, propose adjustments to internal workflows, training programs, or IT systems to improve efficiency and user satisfaction. Use this data to present performance reviews to senior leadership and suggest operational improvements.\nCollaboration: Work closely with other departments, such as IT infrastructure, network, and cybersecurity teams, to address cross-functional technical challenges. Example: When users report network connectivity issues, collaborate with the network team to diagnose whether the issue is due to a hardware failure, misconfiguration, or an external service disruption. Similarly, if a security threat is identified, partner with the cybersecurity team to ensure that all affected users are informed, and systems are properly secured.\nEquipment & Software Management: Oversee the procurement, allocation, and tracking of hardware and software assets. Example: Work with vendors to purchase new equipment when necessary, ensuring that team members have the tools they need to support users. Implement an asset management system to track equipment lifecycle, ensuring that all devices are correctly inventoried and up-to-date with the necessary software patches. For instance, ensure that employee laptops have the latest security updates and software versions installed, and manage the decommissioning of outdated devices.\nService Level Agreement (SLA) Compliance: Ensure all service requests and incidents are managed within the agreed-upon SLA timeframes. Example: Develop a process for categorizing issues based on urgency, ensuring that critical system outages are addressed within minutes, while routine maintenance tasks are completed within the prescribed hours. Periodically review SLAs to ensure that they align with the organization\u2019s evolving needs, and track adherence by generating reports on SLA performance.\nRoot Cause Analysis & Continuous Improvement: Conduct root cause analysis for recurring technical issues, aiming to eliminate the root causes and prevent future occurrences. Example: If the team frequently deals with issues around software crashes, work with the development or vendor team to identify whether there\u2019s a bug in the software. Once identified, collaborate with the vendor to implement fixes and reduce the recurrence of the issue. Implement process changes or preventative measures based on these findings to improve operational efficiency.\nEnd-User Training & Support: Ensure that end-users are properly trained and empowered to resolve basic issues themselves. Example: Develop training programs or materials for employees on common IT issues such as password resets, email configuration, and device setup. Host regular workshops or webinars for users, empowering them to solve common issues on their own and reducing the volume of minor tickets submitted to the support team.\nIncident Communication & Customer Service Excellence: Oversee communication efforts to ensure users are informed and updated regarding the status of their IT issues. Example: When a system-wide outage occurs, set up automated or manual communication channels (such as email notifications, an internal status page, or a message board) to keep users informed of progress. Regularly check in with users after issue resolution to ensure their satisfaction with the process and that all problems have been fully addressed.\nChange Management Support: Support and manage the operational side of change management processes, especially for IT updates, upgrades, or system deployments. Example: Collaborate with project teams to ensure that planned changes (such as software upgrades or hardware deployments) are effectively communicated to the support team and end-users, and ensure any potential disruptions are minimized. Additionally, create a detailed plan to manage the impact of changes on the daily operations of the support team and the broader organization.\nEscalation Path and Issue Resolution Protocol: Create clear escalation paths and protocols for complex IT issues that cannot be resolved by frontline support staff. Example: Develop a tiered support structure where Level 1 support handles basic issues, Level 2 tackles more complex troubleshooting, and Level 3 escalates to subject-matter experts or senior IT staff. Ensure this escalation process is well-documented and that the team understands when to escalate, reducing resolution times for more challenging problems.\nPerforms other duties as assigned.\n\nYour Qualifications:\nBachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or related field (or equivalent experience).\nMinimum of 5 years of experience in IT support, with at least 2 years in a leadership or supervisory role.\nExperience with IT service management tools (e.g., ServiceNow, C2, Jira) and ticketing systems.\nProficiency in troubleshooting Windows and macOS operating systems, Microsoft Office Suite, and common business applications.\nStrong communication skills and the ability to interact effectively with both technical and non-technical users.\nIT certifications (e.g., CompTIA A+, ITIL, Microsoft Certified: Modern Desktop Administrator) are a plus.\nAuthorized to work in the United States\nAble to pass an extensive screening process that includes a drug screen and background check.\n\nYour Skills and Competencies:\n\nCompetencies:\nProfessional, self-motivated, flexible, and able to meet deadlines under a high-volume workload in a fast-paced, constantly changing environment\nKnowledge of a wide range of computer systems, software, applications, hardware, networking, and communications\nSelf-starter and demonstrated the ability to prioritize and manage multiple demands\nAbility to work effectively as part of a team and interact with all levels of the organization\nAttention to detail, strong organization, problem solving, and communication skills\n\nIdeal Skills, Characteristics, & Experiences:\nResults and people-oriented, balancing business considerations\nMicrosoft Office 365 proficiency is a must\nProcess-driven mentality\nHighly organized\nSelf-motivated with a high sense of urgency\nStable, progressive work history\nExcellent communication skills both written and verbal\nActs with integrity\nResilient and adaptable\nCompetitive spirit\nAbility to develop relationships at all levels\nWillingness to get involved in all aspects of the business\n\nGardaWorld: Make the World a Safer Place\n\nIn the United States, GardaWorld Security remains the only guarding security company to be Certified by Great Place to Work.
